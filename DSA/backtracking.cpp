// it basically involves solving a very large and complex problem step by step in parts and once youi solved one part , unit or step you have no need to look at it again ( it includes application of recursion also (basically backtracking in a application of recursion only))-----it helps to solve problems including - decision, optimisation, enumeration


// in backtracking , backtracking call is always executed and written after recursice function calls, as while recursion call stacks are created and while backtracking call stacks are completed and returned with some updations,changes,decisions ,operations etc.
