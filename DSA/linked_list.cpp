// Linked List - It is a linear data structure to store data , the difference in linked list and arrays is that linked list do not need continous available memory to allocate.
// It basically creates memory dynamically on run time and allocate it randomly where
// In this the data members are called nodes where each node contains 2 things[ 1 data and 1 pointer which refers to the next randomly located data member], There is a head pointer which contain pointer of first node  and last node contains either null pointer for linear linked list or pointer of first bucket for circular linked list 
// Now in this we can insert any number of elements at any position in linked list , we can search them , traverse them delete them , create linked list and delete it 

// Linked list can be created by 2 approaches :
// 1) Functions approach
// 2) OOPS approach 

// Here we will learn about OOPS approach as from it we will also come to know about the approach by which these data structured have been built in STL.
