//recursion is basically an approach to solve a big complex problem by breaking it into multiple smaller problems and then compiling it               ,,, in this we move in 2 directions firt downward while reaking problem into multiple small problems providing a base case where breaking of problems stop after that we move in opposite direction that is upward compiling result of various small problem and reaching towards final solution 

//it basically use the technique of call stack where the function first called is lowest in the stack and the function last called ie base function is the highest in the stack and as soon as the result of a call is returned it get removed from stack
