/*
It is a dynamic approach to reduce time complexity of various algorithms by breaking down the problem into smaller problems and iterate over them(recursion) and remembering unique problems calculated and use them in overlapping problems(dynamic programming).

There are 2 approaches of this :->

1. Top Down approaches , we convert bigger problems into smaller and solve them 

2. We start solving smaller problems and from their stored results calculate bigger problems .
