/*
Basically it is a bucket type structure in which we can insert data from top only and also access it from top only as data is stacked one above another , so it is a last in first out structure 

It supports only 3 functions:
1) push(): it pushes data into stack from above
2)pop(): it removes top most data( the last data which you pushed into the stack ) from stack 
3)top(): it access the top most element of stack.
