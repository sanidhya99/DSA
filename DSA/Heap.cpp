/*
Important points :- 
1. Heap is a form of priority queue where we adjust the data so that we can access data acc to some kind of priority later easily 

2. It is visualised in the form of a binary tree and have 2 conditions i.e. (all levels of binary tree must be completely filled except last level , last level can be partially filled),(filling must be in sequence of left to right)

3. It has a order priority :
    A heap can be either a max heap or a min heap (can)

4. It is implemented using arrays .
